  title: "The Leaders Adventure"
  content: "Leadership should be an adventure.  \nA journey of discovery and exploration as we lead those around us.  \n
Sometimes the path we follow may be clear and other times it may be difficult to see.  \n
Sometimes we may have signs or guides to help us and other times we may need to find the way on our own.  \n
Sometimes there is a clear destination and sometimes there isn't.  \n
Sometimes the path will be easy and sometimes there will be obstacles in the way.  \n
Whatever path we take it should be fun, challenging and memorable and hopefully we will end up in a better place than where we started."
