A single, creative decision transformed our interactions with some junior engineers, boosting their morale and integrating them seamlessly into our team.

We are currently employing a couple of students as consultants to help with some infrastructure work. We identify self contained pieces of work and then ask them to research, develop and deliver them. They are supervised by one of our senior engineers, Omar.

When planning the work for the next few months we wanted to highlight tasks that they could potentially pick up. The easiest way to do this was to use a label. In a moment of inspiration Omar decided to use the label "DreamTeam" for all their potential tasks.

This small decision has had a big impact. We take every opportunity to refer to them as the "DreamTeam", and each time it makes them and the rest of the team smile. 

A very simple thing.

I believe it has given them a real boost and shows that we believe in them and that we value the work they do. They are at the very start of their careers, and who knows where it may take them, but hopefully this will have given them just a little bit of a boost.
